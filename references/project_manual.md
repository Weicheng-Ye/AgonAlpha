All BRAIN simulations must be created through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/brain_client.py`; do not send `POST /simulations` directly. The shared client enforces the account-wide concurrency limit across every agent working under `alphas/`.

## Alpha file format

<template>

# Alpha Report: <slug>

## One sentence

State the proposed alpha in one sentence, using LaTeX syntax for the formulae.

### Hypothesis

State the testable market belief behind the alpha. Describe the observed condition and the expected direction of future returns. Briefly explain the economic or behavioral intuition connecting them. Focus on what should happen and why.

## Motivation and explanation

Explain the intuition behind the alpha and the role of each component in its formula.

## Performance

Report the final alpha's simulation settings, performance metrics, and submission checks.

## Alternative attempts

Summarize the main alternatives tested, their results, and why they were pruned.

## Artifacts

List the files needed to inspect or reproduce the work.
