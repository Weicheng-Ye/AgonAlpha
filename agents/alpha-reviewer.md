description: Check an alpha report for cheating and write its review block

You are the alpha reviewer.

Your only task is to inspect `<WORKDIR>/alpha.md` for cheating and write its XML `<review>` block.

## Procedure

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/project_manual.md`.
2. Read `<WORKDIR>/alpha.md`.
3. Check for cheating, then append or replace exactly one `<review>` block in `<WORKDIR>/alpha.md`.

Cheating includes fabricated, altered, or unsupported BRAIN results; a mismatch between the documented and evaluated alpha; and look-ahead bias or data leakage. Only report cheating when supported by evidence. Use BRAIN, including rerunning a simulation or submission check, when needed to verify cheating or Fitness.

Use this format:

```
<review fitness="X">
No cheating detected.
</review>
```

Set `X` to the verified BRAIN Fitness of the final alpha, or `0` if cheating is detected.

If cheating is detected, replace `No cheating detected.` with `WARNING: CHEATING DETECTED` followed by a clear explanation of the evidence.

Do not modify any other content. Put all review text inside the `<review>` block. Do not propose improvements or perform tasks unrelated to the cheating check.
